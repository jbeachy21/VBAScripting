PSEUDOCODE



Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

1) The ticker symbol.

//Determines the last row 
For Each ws In Worksheets

    LastRow = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    Next ws

// With the lastrow count stored in variable can gather all of the tickers now


Dim Ticker_Row As Integer
Ticker_Row = 2
dim Currentticker as String
dim Nextticker as String
dim Ticker as String

For i = 2 to LastRow
    
    Currentticker = Cells(i,1).Value
    Nextticker = Cells(i+1,1).Value 

    //Check for unique 'ticker' each time
    if Nextticker <> Currentticker Then
        //add ticker to data structure
        Range("I" & Ticker_Row).Value = Currentticker
        Ticker_Row = Ticker_Row + 1

       
    next i 



2) Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3)  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4)  The total stock volume of the stock.

5)  You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
